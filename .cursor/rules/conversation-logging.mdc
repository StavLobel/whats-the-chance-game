# Conversation Logging Rule

## Purpose
Track all conversations and interactions with the AI agent for project development history and reference.

## Requirements
- Update conversation-log.txt after each significant interaction
- Include user requests, challenges faced, solutions implemented, and outcomes
- Maintain chronological order with clear session boundaries
- Add timestamps and session markers
- Include technical details and file modifications
- Track key decisions and their rationale

## Format Guidelines
- Use clear section headers with emojis for visual organization
- Include user's exact request in quotes
- Document challenges and how they were resolved
- List all files modified or created
- Include technical implementation details
- Add status indicators (‚úÖ COMPLETED, üîÑ IN PROGRESS, ‚ùå FAILED)
- Maintain consistent formatting throughout the log

## Update Triggers
- After each user request is completed
- When new files are created or modified
- When technical challenges are resolved
- When significant decisions are made
- At the end of each development session

## Content Structure
1. Session overview with date and focus
2. Key interactions in chronological order
3. Technical achievements and challenges
4. Files modified and created
5. Next steps and future considerations

## Security Note
- Do not log sensitive information like API keys or passwords
- Focus on technical implementation and user interactions
- Keep the log focused on development progress and decisions
