3. **Run All Tests**: Ensure 100% test pass rate and 90%+ coverage
4. **Create Pull Request**: From feature branch to main
5. **Pass CI/CD Checks**: All automated tests must pass
6. **Code Review**: Get approval from team member
7. **Merge to Main**: Only after all checks pass
8. **Update GitHub Issue**: Close with implementation summary
9. **Update TASKS.md**: Mark task as completed with completion date
10. **Update Documentation**: Ensure README.md, SRD.md, and API docs are current

### Issue Management:

- All major tasks have corresponding GitHub issues for tracking
