## 📋 Task Completion Workflow

### When Completing Any Task:

1. **Create Feature Branch**: `git checkout -b feature/issue-number-task-name`
2. **Implement with TDD**: Write tests first, then implementation
3. **Run All Tests**: Ensure 100% test pass rate and 90%+ coverage
4. **Create Pull Request**: From feature branch to main
5. **Pass CI/CD Checks**: All automated tests must pass
6. **Code Review**: Get approval from team member
7. **Merge to Main**: Only after all checks pass
8. **Update GitHub Issue**: Close with implementation summary
9. **Update TASKS.md**: Mark task as completed with completion date
10. **Update Documentation**: Ensure README.md, SRD.md, and API docs are current

### Issue Management:

- All major tasks have corresponding GitHub issues for tracking
- Use appropriate labels (bug, feature, enhancement, etc.)
- Include acceptance criteria in issue descriptions
- Link issues to related tasks in this document
