The ultimate social game of chance and challenges! Dare your friends and see if fate is on your side.

## 🎮 What is "What's the Chance?"

"What's the Chance?" is a fun social game where players challenge each other with entertaining tasks. The twist? Whether you have to complete the challenge depends on a game of chance using number matching!

### How It Works

1. **Challenge Someone** - Create a fun challenge and tag a friend (e.g., "What's the chance you'll sing karaoke?")
2. **Pick Numbers** - Set a range (1-10, 1-50, etc.) and both players secretly pick a number within that range
3. **Reveal & Decide** - If the numbers match, the challenge must be completed! If not, you're off the hook

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Simple Rules** - Easy to learn, impossible to put down
- 👥 **Social Gaming** - Perfect for parties, friend groups, and team building
- 🎨 **Beautiful UI** - Modern design with smooth animations
- 📱 **Responsive** - Works great on all devices
- ⚡ **Instant Play** - No registration required, start playing immediately
