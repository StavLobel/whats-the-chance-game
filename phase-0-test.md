# Phase 0: Branch Protection & CI/CD Test

This file is created to test the branch protection and CI/CD pipeline configuration.

## Test Objectives

1. **Branch Protection**: Verify that direct pushes to main are blocked
2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Verify that pull requests trigger the pipeline
3. **Status Checks**: Verify that all required checks pass before merge
4. **Code Review**: Verify that pull request reviews are required

## Current Status

- ✅ CI/CD pipeline configured for PR triggers
- ⏳ Branch protection rules need configuration
- ⏳ Status checks need verification
- ⏳ Code review requirements need setup

## Next Steps

1. Configure branch protection rules in GitHub
2. Test the complete workflow
3. Verify all quality gates are enforced
4. Update documentation with new workflow
